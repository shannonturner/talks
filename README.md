## Trainings you can hire me for

Did you know that Hear Me Code isn't my day job -- it's something I do in my free time? Since starting Hear Me Code in 2013, I have developed a robust curriculum to help my students learn how to code. I've taught dozens of times, trained dozens of teachers, and over time have iterated and refined the curriculum to integrate the best teaching methods into the materials.

Each of these lessons is four hours long and covers the most important skills and concepts you'll need to learn Python and begin building practical projects.

* Introduction to Python: Lesson 1 (Strings & Conditionals)
* Introduction to Python: Lesson 2 (Lists & Loops)
* Introduction to Python: Lesson 3 (Dictionaries & Files)
* Introduction to Python: Lesson 4 (Functions)
* Introduction to Python: Lesson 5 (APIs)
* Web Development in Python with Django
