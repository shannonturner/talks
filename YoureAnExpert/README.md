## You're an Expert. Here's how to Teach Like One

### Description

Knowing how to code and being able to teach it are two separate skills. When we have expertise in a subject, it's common to take for granted that we'll be able to effectively communicate our expertise to someone else. You'll learn (or re-learn!) how to teach and discover practical examples you can put to work right away.

By sharpening your teaching skills, you'll be a more effective mentor, trainer, presenter, and team member

### Audience

No previous teaching experience is required, but this talk can benefit anyone who trains, mentors, or teaches others (formally or informally), especially:

* Someone who mentors a junior developer and wants to help them reach their potential
* Someone who manages mid-level developers
* Someone who communicates technical information to non-developers
* Someone who trains developers or teaches coding at any level
* Someone who wants to speak or give a tutorial at a conference

### Length
