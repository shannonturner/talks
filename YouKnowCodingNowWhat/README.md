## You know the fundamentals of coding. Now what?

### Description

Want to build a project to improve your skills, but not sure how to get started? Here's how.

This talk balances considering personal goals, choosing a project to work on, and the actual mechanics of how I built a select set of features for a prototype that eventually became [Metro Map Maker](https://metromapmaker.com)

### Audience

This talk is designed especially for people who want to create a personal project for fun, to build their skills and portfolio, or at a hackathon, but aren't sure how to start.

While this talk does show some HTML, CSS, and Javascript to illustrate prototyping, the concepts are broadly applicable and this talk is primarily aimed at audiences who have some coding experience but haven't yet built many projects on their own.
