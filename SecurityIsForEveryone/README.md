## Security is for Everyone

### Description

Learn the most practical, impactful steps to take to safeguard your computer and accounts online.

There are a lot of digital security guides on the internet. Unfortunately, most of them are not beginner-friendly and fail to consider the most common types of threats people are likely to face.

I designed Security is for Everyone exactly with this in mind: what are the practical things that non-experts can do to protect themselves online against the most common threats?
